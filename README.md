# Another_attempt_at_the_tennis_tournament
Group Project for the tennis tournament
Designed as a theoretical interface for a tennis community
Built to connect those in age appropriate tournaments with an invisible ranking system
Upon joining a tournament it will expand or contract to fit the number of players entered
An alarm clock reminds participants when the tournament is upon sign in
When the tournament has passed a similar alarm prompts proctor to fill in results
Upon submission from the proctor the tournament is deleted and the points for the invisible ranking system are awarded.
Many to many coming soon for multiple tournament enlistment as well as a lock of player registation upon passing tournament date
